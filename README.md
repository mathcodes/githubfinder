axios, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-scripts

Understanding of the following concepts are required to build this app to its full capacity.
 - Components, props, state
 - environment variables
 - HTTP req res
 - Class, Lifecycle
 - Functions, Hooks
 - Context API w/ useContext & use Reducer

Challenge when building this app: 
 - Build it with class based components & stateless functional components, then refactor it to all functional components using hooks.
 - Refactor it to use state managemant with the context API along with some of the newer hooks that can help uscreate a nice flux pattern.
 - Then deploy to Netlify

More details coming asap!!!
